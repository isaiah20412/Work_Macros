# Work_Macros

This project is designed to emulate the ability to use macros at my workplace (Crown Motors), in order to speed up my workflow and increase productivity.
The basic idea is that an Arduino compatible board (as long as it supports emulation a keyboard), will be able to take input from buttons and execute pre-programmed keystrokes that will either execute some kind of in-program action on the connected computer, or input a pre-determined string of text.
